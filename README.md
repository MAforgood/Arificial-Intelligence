Artificial Intelligence Projects - Spring 2024

These projects were developed as part of my Artificial Intelligence course in Spring 2024. Each project focuses on implementing different AI techniques to solve challenging problems.
Projects:

    Water Sort Puzzle Solver
        Implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) and A* Algorithm for solving the Water Sort Puzzle.

    Sudoku Solver
        Backtracking algorithm implementation for solving Sudoku puzzles.
        Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) with Forward-Checking technique.

    2048 Game Solver
        Expectimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) implementations for solving the 2048 game.

    Sampling Techniques
